<!-- Psuedo Code -->
<!-- Create variables: URL string, topics array OF STRINGS -->
<!-- Set up string for Query URL Gifphy -->
<!-- factors to include in API = search topic, return# = 10(not a variable) -->

<!-- API key GIPHY = X3NRL2r2wTw6jM1ZcmdBZ6rBkn0LveSY -->

<!-- Make sure you switch the protocol in the query URL from **`http to https`**, 
or the app may not work properly when deployed to Github Pages.

Use a for loop with the array
Create button for every topics array item - use append

3. When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
Each topics button should grab a gif url
- make the url static using attributes of animated and static like we did in the activities Friday

4. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
this is like the Friday activity
       
5. Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
    * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.-->





 

<!--     
//     ### Instructions
//     * Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.
// 6. Add a form to your page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your `topics` array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.

// 7. Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.

// 8. **Rejoice**! You just made something really cool.

// ### Minimum Requirements

// Attempt to complete homework assignment as described in instructions. If unable to complete certain portions, please pseudocode these portions to describe what remains to be completed. Adding a README.md as well as adding this homework to your portfolio are required as well and more information can be found below.

// - - -

// ### Bonus Goals

// 1. Ensure your app is fully mobile responsive.

// 2. Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.
//    * Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.

// 3. List additional metadata (title, tags, etc) for each gif in a clean and readable format.

// 4. Include a 1-click download button for each gif, this should work across device types.

// 5. Integrate this search with additional APIs such as OMDB, or Bands in Town. Be creative and build something you are proud to showcase in your portfolio

// 6. Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a `favorites` section.
//    * This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.
//    * If you are looking for a major challenge, look into making this section persist even when the page is reloaded(via localStorage or cookies). --> --> --> -->
